Work on relocating the club’s repeater continues to move forward. GVARC project team members visited the new site last Monday, and are pleased to report steady progress.  

We now have a functioning electrical outlet at the location, along with a proper ground wire — a significant step that ensures reliable and safe operation. We also met with Henry, who will be our primary point of contact at the site going forward.  

The repeater racks have been bolted down and secured. Space is tighter than we’d like, so the racks sit closer together than ideal, but everything fits. With some careful planning, we’ll work around the challenges.  

We still need to mount our own ground plate and perform some prep work before the final move. The plan is to hold off until after the MS 150 bike event on October 4–5, which will use the current repeater setup. We anticipate completing the move the following week.  

Thanks to everyone lending their time, tools, and ideas to ensure the move is smooth. Stay tuned for more updates as we approach the final installation.
