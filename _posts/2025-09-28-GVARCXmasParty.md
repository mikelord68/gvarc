> “Mark it on your calendar; the GVARC Christmas Party is on Saturday, December 13th at Granzins BBQ in the same location as we have our normal Saturday breakfast. 
>
> Plan on being there at 6'ish PM or a tad before. Get a beverage of your choice and meet in the private room. About 6 or when stomachs demand, we'll all go and order what we wish for dinner off of the menu.
>
> All GVARC members and family are invited.  Additionally, any other friends of GVARC are welcome whether licensed or not or an "official" member of GVARC or not.
>
> Please join us to celebrate friendship, our hobby, and the holiday season.
>
> NOTE: In addition to the Christmas party, the normal Saturday club breakfast get together is still on so come to one or both as you wish."
