Great progress has been made at the new repeater site. Over the past week, the team has completed the equipment move, secured power and grounding, and begun on-air testing of both repeaters.

Recent adjustements to the initial configuration has resulted in significantly improved system performane on both bands.

The 147.000 MHz repeater is now transmitting with range comparable to the previous site, though receive sensitivity still needs minor adjustment. The likely cause is a shifted tuning stub on the VHF duplexer, which will be corrected soon.

The 443.850 MHz repeater is performing markedly better. Additional signal reports from outlying areas are welcome to help with fine-tuning.

Next steps include final duplexer alignment, adding battery backup, and reestablishing Wires-X and remote access.
